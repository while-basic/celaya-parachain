## ðŸš€ Live Features

### 1. **Real-Time Dashboard Overview**
- **Live System Monitoring**: Real-time CPU, memory, and network metrics with updating charts
- **Agent Status Tracking**: 4 simulated agents (Lens, Core, Echo, Theory) with live performance data
- **Interactive Charts**: Line charts for system performance, pie charts for agent distribution
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time activity stream with automatic updates every 5 seconds
- **Performance Metrics**: Live calculation of response times, task completion rates, system load

**Try it:** Watch the dashboard update in real-time with live metrics and agent status changes.

### 2. **Advanced Tool Call Interface**
- **Real Agent Tools**: 4 different agent types with authentic tool definitions
  - Lens Agent: `lens_analyze_image` - Computer vision analysis
  - Core Agent: `core_process_task` - Complex task processing
  - Echo Agent: `echo_audit_insight` - Compliance auditing
  - Theory Agent: `theory_validate_model` - Mathematical validation

- **Interactive Parameter Configuration**: Dynamic form generation based on tool parameters
- **Execution Simulation**: Real async execution with status tracking (pending â†’ running â†’ completed)
- **Results Visualization**: JSON formatted results with mock data that resembles real agent outputs
- **Execution History**: Persistent history of all tool calls with timing and results

**Try it:** 
1. Go to Tools section
2. Select any agent tool
3. Fill in parameters
4. Execute and watch real-time status updates
5. View detailed results in JSON format

### 3. **Multi-Agent Simulation Engine**

  - Interactive start/stop/reset controls

- **Comprehensive Results**: Detailed analysis including efficiency scores, collaboration metrics, and actionable recommendations

**Try it:**
1. Go to Simulation section
2. Click "New Simulation"
3. Select a scenario
4. Watch live progress with updating charts
5. View comprehensive results analysis

### 4. **Real-Time Data Updates**
- **Auto-Refreshing Metrics**: System performance data updates every 2 seconds
- **Live Activity Stream**: New activities added every 5 seconds
- **Agent Health Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and response time tracking
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded status badges with real-time updates

### 5. **Interactive UI Components**
