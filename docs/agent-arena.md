### **Live Agent Arena**

Run agents **in observable simulation** with timestamps, logs, memory hits:

* 🔁 Real-time tick-based simulation of all 13 agents.
* Each one logs decisions, votes, emotions (if simulated), and actions.
* Display in CLI or Textual dashboard: who did what, when, what it was <thinking>, and why.
* Label this the “Agent Consensus Arena” or **Agent Arena**.

### **Snapshot + Restore**

Build a `c-suite.snapshot()` command:

* Takes a full memory state + agent config at a moment in time.
* Use this to rollback, clone agents, run A/B tests on reasoning models.

Use case: “I want to fork Otto just before he made that decision and see if a different model would’ve chosen better.”

## 🧬 Visual Frontend Ideas

* **Multi-agent Timeline**: Scrollable horizontal log of who spoke, what CID they submitted, how others reacted.
* **Agent XP Progression Bars**: Show live “level-up” of agents per minted Insight.
* **Replay Mode**: Rewind a moment in agent time, view all inputs, thoughts, outputs, votes.
* **Action Heatmaps**: Visualize which agents are most active, most trusted, or most contradicted.
