# 🧠 COGNITIONS — The Mental Programs of the C-Suite

---

## 🔍 What Is a Cognition?

A **Cognition** is a modular, declarative reasoning unit executed across one or more C-Suite agents.
It encapsulates:

* Intent
* Agent roles
* Orchestration logic
* Success conditions
* Risk safeguards
* Memory impact

> Think of a Cognition like a “cognitive API endpoint”—an internal mental call that triggers emergent group behavior.

## 🧠 Cognition Lifecycle

| Phase                | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧭 **Trigger**       | Started by Lyra, user prompt, or sensor/agent interrupt     |
| 🔁 **Orchestration** | Agents follow phased roleplay with memory + context         |
| 🔐 **Verification**  | Outcome is checked (consensus, task completion, audit)      |
| 📚 **Memory Sync**   | Logs, insights, or events stored to Recall and/or FAISS     |
| ✅ **Outcome State**  | Success/failure reported to dashboard with confidence score |

## 🧠 Cognition Capabilities

| Function                  | Capability                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Contextual thinking    | Agents access scoped memory to reason together          |
| 🔀 Multi-agent sequencing | Timed or condition-based role handoffs                  |
| 🧾 Self-logging           | Every phase can generate a CID-linked audit trail       |
| 🛡️ Embedded safety       | Quorum or risk flags trigger halts or alerts            |
| 🧬 Evolution              | Lyra can clone, mutate, or improve Cognitions over time |

---

## 🎛️ Cognition Control (Admin Panel Integration)

Admin can:

* View cognition registry
* Trigger cognitions manually
* Monitor current execution state
* Create/modify using Lyra DSL:

  > “Create cognition `diagnostic_split` using Echo + Volt, store insights to Recall, end with Sentinel check.”

## 🔄 Cognition vs. Moment

| Feature        | Cognition                        | Moment                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Purpose        | Encapsulated reasoning unit      | Orchestrated agent flow |
| Structure      | Modular + reusable               | Often ad hoc            |
| Persistence    | Versioned, composable            | Logged, but transient   |
| Security Hooks | Agent role, memory gates, quorum | Optional, less formal   |

**Moments = instances of behavior**
**Cognitions = reusable logic modules powering Moments**

---

## 🔒 Security Hooks

Each Cognition can specify:

* `min_trust_score` per agent
* `authorized_initiators` (Lyra, human, other cognition)
* `required_memories` (e.g. CID of approved context)
* `quorum_required: true/false`
* `reputation_penalty_on_fail`

---

## 💬 Example CLI

```bash
> cognition:list

- voltchain_handoff 🔁
- weighted_voting_escalation 🗳️
- system_quorum_kill 🔥
- recursion_reflex_01 ♻️

> cognition:run voltchain_handoff

> cognition:define strategic_drift_watch --agents=Theory,Core,Sentinel --risk=high
```

---

## 📡 Vision: Future Extensions

* **Auto-suggestion of Cognitions** based on recurring agent tasks
* **Scored cognition outcomes** to influence agent evolution
* **Cognition Packets**: exportable modules for sharing across deployments
* **Visual Cognition Builder**: low-code drag-and-drop orchestration tool
