## üß∞ CORE EXTENSIONS TO EXISTING TOOLS

You can also **enhance current tools** with flags or layered capabilities:

- `memory.save(memory, { notarize: true, replayable: true })`
- `tools.call_agent(agent, task, { quorum_required: true })`
- `security.log_risk(event, { notify: ["Lyra", "Sentinel"], severity: "high" })`

## üí° Meta Tip: Agent Tool Discovery

Consider a universal:

```
tools.search("risk")

```

‚Ä¶to return all tools across every category with `"risk"` in their name, purpose, or metadata.
