## üîë **What Your Blockchain Must Provide for Every Agent**

**1. On-chain Agent Registry**

* Agent ID, role, public key, status, and trust score
* Track online/offline, upgrades, retirement

**2. Immutable Log Pallet**

* Store: timestamp, agent(s) involved, action type, output hash/CID, all agent signatures
* Query by agent, role, event type

**3. Signature/Identity Enforcement**

* Every action, output, or decision is signed (using SR25519/ED25519 per agent)
* Multi-sig support for high-stakes events

**4. Consensus Record Tracking**

* Store and verify when multiple agents agree on an outcome
* Track which agents signed, result hash, and time

**5. Reputation/Trust Scoring**

* Increment/decrement per event (e.g., did agent show up for consensus, did they have a disputed output, etc.)

**6. Event Types**

* At minimum: `InsightLogged`, `ConsensusReached`, `AlertRaised`, `ActionExecuted`, `AgentStatusChanged`

**7. CID/Hash Storage**

* Store arbitrary hashes (IPFS, Arweave, internal)
* Attach to log events, insights, or data fetches

**8. Role-based Permissions**

* Some actions require ‚Äúsuper agent‚Äù or multi-sig
* Enforce on-chain

---

## üèóÔ∏è **Forward-Looking Requirements** (5 Steps Ahead)

* **Agent Upgrades:** Log all software/logic upgrades as chain events, signed by Lyra/Core
* **Delegated Authority:** Allow Lyra to delegate temporary authority on-chain
* **Anomaly Flags:** Let Sentinel/Volt flag events for audit review
* **Off-chain Data Hooks:** Record pointers for large files/images via CID (on-chain only holds the hash, real file on IPFS/Arweave)
* **Audit Trail Export:** Build an export tool for all agent logs/decisions as legal-grade, timestamped proof

---

## ‚ö° **How This All Fits: The C-Suite ‚ÄúProof of Machine Intelligence‚Äù Chain**

* Every **agent** = an on-chain identity (can be queried, proven, upgraded)
* Every **output** = a signed, hashed, timestamped event (verifiable and auditable)
* Every **decision/consensus** = cryptographically proven, never hand-waved
* **Human users, partners, and regulators** can audit everything with a script, CLI, or dashboard
