| `cognition.plan` | Break down a user goal into subtasks |
| `cognition.explain_action` | Justify the last task the agent took |
| `cognition.generate_dream` | Create a hypothetical outcome from memory (Dream Engine) |
| `cognition.log_emotion` | Log emotional state, confidence, or doubt |
| `cognition.ask_past_self`too | Pull from a prior memory as if asking a former version of itself |
