## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions
- **Client-side Only**: All integration runs in browser for demo purposes
- **Mock Services**: Realistic simulation of blockchain and IPFS services
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Features degrade gracefully if services unavailable
- **State Management**: Centralized Zustand stores for all integration state

### Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient Polling**: Smart polling intervals for different data types
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup of intervals and connections
- **Lazy Loading**: Components load only when needed
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of integration failures

### Security Considerations
- **No Private Keys**: Demo uses mock authentication
- **Sandboxed Environment**: All operations contained within application
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents overwhelming mock services
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs properly sanitized
